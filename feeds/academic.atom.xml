The Bologna accords have tried to create a structure within which it is easy for students to study wherever they want. There have been many cases that emphasize the role of the exchange of students within the European project to further integration. Yet Member States have a dual view of these developments. On the one hand, they benefit from young talent that comes to their country and from the talent they send (and which hopefully returns) to gather knowledge. On the other, higher education is a costly affair and there is the constant fear of actually subsidizing students whose home-nation's education system is failing or to expensive. This has lead to complex systems of student support which often have a 'sufficient link' component. The Court of Justice has taken a strict approach to these systems. Although, as in social policy, Member States are allowed to require a sufficient link for students to be granted benefits, this policy can not be arbitrary or discriminatory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece will argue that a recent case against the Netherlands illustrates that the Court's conception of citizenship, foregoing in part the concept of nationality, is either to idealistic for its own good, or needs to be more rigorously enforced to truly solve issues of social polity.  Be forewarned that the following is not so much a legal analysis, as it is the opinion of the author on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Martens case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recently decided &lt;a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-359/13" title="Martens case"&gt;Martens case&lt;/a&gt; deals with the so-called three-out-of-six rule (3-6 rule) that establishes which persons are eligible for &lt;em&gt;Meeneembare Studie Financiering&lt;/em&gt; (MNSF) in the Netherlands. MNSF is the system that allows students to pursue a study outside of the Netherlands, but with the benefits of the &lt;em&gt;prestatiebeurs&lt;/em&gt; system (the basic scholarship at the time whereby part of the grant does not need to be reimbursed by the student if a ECTS limit is reached) that they would have enjoyed had they chosen a study within The Netherlands. The 3-6 rule states that this possibility will only be open for those prospective students that have spent at least three out of the six years preceding their studies in The Netherlands. It is a basic solidarity clause. Within the European Union, social benefits are to a certain extent allowed to be limited to persons who have demonstrated a certain connection to the benefactor state, yet as this case will demonstrate, it is a thin line to tread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miss Martens has Dutch nationality as she is born in the Netherlands to Dutch parents, who when she is six moved to Belgium. Consequently, she has resided there until she finished her primary and secondary education. Her father has worked in Belgium since moving there in 1993, and only briefly had part-time employment in the Netherlands from 2006 till 2008. After finishing her secondary education, she chose the Netherlands Antilles University in Curaçao as her place of tertiary education. In her application for MNSF, she stated that she had fulfilled the 3-6 rule after which she received her student grants. During her studies, the Belgian government supported her parents, yet as Belgium does not have a system of student grants in place, she herself did not receive financial support from the Belgian state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 it is established by the DUO that miss Martens had in fact not fulfilled the condition that she has lawfully resided in the Netherlands for three out of the preceding six years. As a result she was notified via a (delegated) decision by the Minister for Education that she was obliged to pay back the €19481.64 she had received. Miss Martens contested this decision, stating that this would go against her rights as the dependant of a cross border worker under Regulation 1612/68 and Article 45 TFEU. In earlier cases the Court had rejected such schemes and even explicitly the Dutch 3-6 rule, in case &lt;a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-542/09" title="Commission v. Netherlands"&gt;C-542/09&lt;/a&gt; as discriminatory with regards to cross border workers. The Centrale Raad van Beroep however makes a preliminary reference as the status of Miss Martens is not clear. Surely, miss Martens father is no longer to be considered a cross border worker for the sake of the definition of the awarding of MSNF. The referring tribunal is aware of the judgment in C-542/09, but considers this case to fall outside of that scope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The fall-out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Martens case is not only interesting for the, somewhat more political, point that the author intends to make in the following section. The A-G and the Court come to the same result, yes this case fall under the scope of C-542/09 and is not allowed, but via completely different routes. Whereas A-G Sharpston goes to great length to clarify that time since the father has made use of his worker's rights should not be an issue in these questions as the point is that rules such as the one under contention, limit the rights of each person to move, reside and find gainful employment within the European Union. A Dutch national would be deterred to seek cross-border employment if this results in the loss of rights for his dependants, such as student grants. The point of Union citizenship was, in the A-G's opinion of a secondary nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court however, bases its conclusion completely on the status of Union citizenship. The 3-6 rule will have a negative effect on the rights of EU citizens to make use of their rights under Article 21(1) of the TFEU. Union law does not force Member States to create a system of financial support for students, yet when they do choose to do so, these rules should not infringe upon the inherent rights of Union citizens to make use of the freedoms ensured by the Treaty and &lt;a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32004L0038" title="Citizenship Directive"&gt;Directive 2004/38&lt;/a&gt;. The 3-6 rule tries to establish a sufficient link between the Netherlands and the recipient of the grant, which is allowed (see &lt;a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-220/12" title="Thiele Meneses"&gt;C-220/12 Thiele Meneses&lt;/a&gt; ) yet it is disproportional. The Court is of the opinion that it: “[...]is [...] too exclusive because it does not make it possible to take account of other factors which may connect such a student to the Member State providing the benefit, such as the nationality of the student, his schooling, family, employment, language skills or the existence of other social and economic factors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The post-nation citizen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clear from the outset that the Netherlands would lose this case. There has been extensive case law on the free movement of students and, in all fairness, even though the former minister of education Halbe Zijlstra has argued that the 3-6 rule was drafted with European Law in mind, it is of a completely arbitrary nature. Yet it is the Court's firm wording on what grounds are allowed to confirm a sufficient link with the Member State that triggers the criticism of the author. It is the fact that the Court gives such primacy to the fundamental nature of European Citizenship which is becoming untenable in cases such as the one currently discussed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of Citizenship is to a large extent logical given the place it has been given since the Lisbon Treaty and the ongoing enmeshing of the Member States. If we accept the fact that, within certain logical limits, every EU citizen is allowed to freely make use of the shared space that the Treaties have created within the outer border of the Union, it is clear that there is a need for the elimination of those concrete hindrances such as the threat of loss of nationality (&lt;a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-135/08" title="Rottmann"&gt;C-135/08 Rottmann&lt;/a&gt;) or the expulsion of a third country national spouse (&lt;a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-202/13" title="McCarthy"&gt;C-202/13 McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;). The fact that the Court allows the protection of the basic tenets of the social-democratic state through the sufficient link doctrine is logical. However, the current case illustrates the problems the Union faces in this phase of transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is as follows, if Union Citizenship is the fundamental nature of all who are awarded this status, than why is miss Martens so beholden to the Dutch State. Yes, she has Dutch citizenship, yet her link with her motherland is tenuous at best. It is only the fact that there is a system of student support that has created a new relationship between her and the Netherlands. If Union Citizenship is our fundamental status, the focal point of our rights to live and reside where we want, and if we accept that social support schemes need a sufficient link to the benefactor state to be granted, than why is there still such a focus on the original nationality? The reasoning of the Court is both impractical in its idealism, yet at the same time does not carry the point far enough. Miss Martens is for all intents and purposes linked to the Belgian state. Had she chosen to reside somewhere else, that choice to reside should have been sufficient to be awarded the benefits that come with the place of residence. In an era of true post-nation citizenship, what does the label of being 'Dutch' or 'Belgian' mean except as an indicator of heritage, not of rights. Had the Court truly chosen for EU citizenship, it would have tried to minimise the role that nationality plays in this discussion. Why should mere heritage play a role in the awarding of benefits, where factual link and the choice one makes to work and reside is of so much more importance. EU Member State citizenship is what gives us EU citizens our status, but in a shared legal space in which we are all free to work and reside where ever we want, this should be the only point of importance. Who pays for social benefits or education or any other social scheme should be the State with which you have a conscious connection, the State that benefits from that connection, not the one which you only think of when you hand over a passport while boarding.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="eu law"></category><category term="citizenship"></category><category term="education"></category></entry><entry><title>Difficult to Relate</title><link href="http://mjvw.github.io/first-blog.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-05T23:55:00+01:00</published><author><name>mjvw</name></author><id>tag:mjvw.github.io,2017-02-05:first-blog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Judicial review has the peculiar quality that it is exemplary in illustrating the history and nature of a state, and in doing so it equally offers an insight into the relation between citizens and state. It is the one point in any judicial order in which all elements comprising the state, meet each other and the balance between them is made clear. Although foreseen in certain constitutional orders, in post-autocratic states such as France and the USA, the importance of judicial review has taken a leap in importance with the rise of the modern bureaucratic state. Where in earlier days there was a logic to limiting judicial review due to the fact that acts by government where often laden with at least some democratic gravitas, the bureaucratic state is filled with a plethors of agencies, each with different legal means, through which it interacts with citizens. Judicial review is, in short, an important indication of the nature of the State. It is the changing nature of the European Union that is giving the Court of Justice (CJEU) headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States have evolved in their take on judicial review. In France the review of legislative acts has always been impossible due to the historically strong role of parliament.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Administrative law was even held to be explicitly different, a lesser beast so to speak, compared to Private and Criminal law. Acts of a lower nature though, were never free from scrutiny and the administrative courts have slowly but surely taken a more progressive stance against the evolving state. Possibilities for review have expanded both in scope of applicants and in quality of the act. Perhaps the most striking example is the enormous development that the English legal system has gone through since WWII, in part due to for instance the judiciary reaction to the Crichel Down affair.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At the start of the twentieth century, it would be unheard of for a private applicant to successfully challenge the State. It was the State who embodied the notion of “The Public Good”. Yet through the judicial application of concepts as fairness, unreasonableness and the un-English concept of proportionality, England and Wales now poses a robust system of judicial review of administrative acts. Judicial review and all its aspects are therefore a legalised representation of the society in which it takes place; a sketch of the societal and democratic relations between institutions and citizens and the changes therein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now consider the system of judicial review as it is set up in European Law. Since the early days of the European Economic Community in 1962, the Court has held that private individuals are only permitted to request the review of an act of the (then) EEC or one of its institutions that is not addressed to that individual, when the individual is affected by that act due to specific circumstances that mark him in a manner as to being similar to an addressee.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This stems from the Courts interpretation of the term “individual concern” as it is mentioned in the article on the review of acts the (now) European Union: “Any natural or legal person may, under the conditions laid down in the first and second paragraphs, institute proceedings against an act addressed to that person or which is of direct and individual concern to them, and against a regulatory act which is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hurdle of individual concern has been very difficult to overcome. The very nature of EU law makes it virtually impossible for any party to claim that he or she is affected in such a specific manner as most acts will have a very wide and far reaching effect. Where it may seem logical in Member States to exclude legislative acts from judicial review in order to separate the powers, this separation can have a perverse effect in the European legal order. Commentary over the years has focussed its anger on the Court who, in the system of the European Union, is the ultimate interpreter and thus has the power to easily interpret the clause in any other way. Yet in 60 years since Plaumann, it has to much amazement never seen fit to do so. 
In discussions on the enforcement of environmental rights within the EU's legal order,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; an especially difficult discussion given the fact that these rights are by their nature not individualisable, it became clear that after 50 years of critique from both Academia&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the Court's own Advocates – General,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the Court does not merely see this as a strict interpretation of the Treaty text, but that this text reflects the nature of the legal instruments of the Union which are by and large of a legislative nature given the manner in which they are adopted. This has shed some light on the stance of the Court. As with the nature of the regimes in the Member States, the Court is of opinion that the high threshold for review is a reflection of the nature of the relationship between the Union and citizens. Since most of the acts undertaken are endowed with at least a modicum of democratic deliberation, they are not meant for the individual complainant to take issue with. This approach clarifies the constant reiteration by the CJEU that it is for Member States to provide full remedies,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; even when the complaint is addressed against a European act. The CJEU sees the national legal orders as the first step in a federal appeal system in which matters can be resolved through referral, not through direct appeal.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Given the above, the advent of the Lisbon Treaty inadvertently triggered an existential question for the Court. Although the Constitution for Europe and the overhaul of its legal instruments did not survive,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote10"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the Article on judicial review was adapted, in part as a reaction to the long history of criticism mentioned earlier.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote11"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, the change implicitly refers to a category of legal instrument that was foreseen in the Constitution and is now difficult to categorise. The result is that the restrictive qualifier 'individual concern' is no longer used “against a regulatory act which is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures.”. The problem being that “regulatory act” is a term of art unknown before Lisbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both textual scrutiny and the literal interpretation by the Court of Justice have yielded the most obvious meaning of this addition.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote12"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There is now official recognition of the fact that the modern EU has a more direct relationship with its citizens that was previously deemed to be the case. Here the crux of the Court's current conundrum is found. Because although the drafters of the Treaty clearly envisioned this innovation to have only a limited reach, solving a problem with the smallest possible impact, there are groups such as the environmental movement who want to make full use of the possibilities this offers. And so, the interpretation of a seemingly small change has lead the Court to actually evaluate how it sees the relationship between Union and Citizens. If there is a direct relationship, then under the Court's own interpretation to the rule of law, citizens should be able to address possible infringements of their rights. However, the Court has to be well aware of the history in the Member States of the road that will be taken if this nascent form of administrative law were initiated. Like its founding members, the EU is undergoing the changes that every legal system goes through. The nature of the Union has kept it sheltered from this reality, yet that to has now passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main question is now whether the CJEU is going to follow the same route as many of its peers in the Member States. For the moment the answer appears to be “No”.  The drafting of the Lisbon Treaty has reinforced the Court's view of the relationship between citizen and EU. Consequently, it has interpreted both the concepts of “regulatory act not entailing implementing measures” and “direct concern” restrictively, whilst reaffirming its view of the decentralised nature of the European judicial structure. So even though the CJEU has brought about significant change in other legal orders, changes that have had a manifest impact on the relationship between citizens and Member States, it refuses to do so for the Union.&lt;/p&gt;
