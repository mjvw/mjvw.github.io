&lt;p&gt;The Aarhus Convention is an international agreement, signed in 1998 in the Danish city which lends it its name, that aims to establish thresholds for the procedural rights that facilitate the defence of the environment by those who it affects, or by public interest organisations. This means that the Convention aims to achieve easier access to information, participation and justice when it comes to the decisions that governments take on all issues dealing with the environment. A lot has been written about this interesting piece of legislation,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as the Convention acknowledges the fact that one of the great problems regarding the effectuation of substantive environmental rights, has been the system of procedural rules that each government can create to hinder the process. 
The Compliance Committee (ACCC) is the non-judicial body of the Convention which aims to help signatory states to reach compliance. Although the Committee is non-judicial in nature and as such does not produce judgments, but rather opinions and advice which can be adopted by the Meeting of Parties, its placement within the system gives it a court-like quality. It is therefore not surprising that a number of Environmental NGOs &lt;a href="https://www.clientearth.org/eu-breaching-access-justice-law-un-committee-finds/"&gt;cried 'Victory!'&lt;/a&gt; when the ACCC recently &lt;a href="http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/pp/compliance/C2008-32/Findings/C32_EU_Findings_as_adopted_advance_unedited_version.pdf"&gt;gave an opinion&lt;/a&gt; where it found the EU to be non-compliant with its obligations under the Convention. 
To the opinion of the ACCC, the EU is in breach of the Convention due to the Court of Justice of the EU's (CJEU) interpretation of the standing criteria under the action for annulment (Article 263 TFEU). This article allows for the judicial review of acts by the EU by the Court. Access to the Court to have an act review is open to Member States and Institutions, no matter the reason or the act in question (these are called 'privileged applicants). Other institutions are allowed to initiate proceedings against acts that affect their privileges under the Treaty (semi-privileged applicants). A logical third category is those natural and/or legal persons that want to have a decision of which they are the addressee reviewed. But it is the fourth category that has been a long standing point of discussion for students of EU law.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Natural or legal person who are not the addressee of an act, may request that act to be reviewed if the acts is of direct or individual concern to them, or, since the entry into effect of the Lisbon Treaty, when directly concerned by an act of a regulatory nature which is not subject to an implementing measure. 
The Aarhus Convention requires signatories to implement a system of access to justice that allows wide access for environmental NGOs (and individuals who want to protect against the detriment of their own environment). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee Procedure (2010 - 2017)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every great war consists of numerous battles that make up the narrative. The procedure before the ACCC, brought by a number of eNGOs can be seen as one long list of skirmishes with an unclear end resolution of the war. In 2010, communicants (as is the wording of the Convention) under leadership of ClientEarth, notified the ACCC of the fact that to their opinion the EU wasn't compliant with its responsibilities under the Convention. According to the communicants, the CJEU's interpretation of Article 230 TEC (now 263 TFEU) was to strict. Due to the (in)famous &lt;em&gt;Plaumann&lt;/em&gt; doctrine, it was realistically impossible for public interest organisations to have an act by the Union reviewed by the Court, as by their very nature it would be impossible for them to differentiate themselves as &lt;em&gt;individual concerned&lt;/em&gt;. The criteria for being &lt;em&gt;individually concerned&lt;/em&gt; were first set out in the &lt;em&gt;Plaumann&lt;/em&gt; case, and required applicants that would like to see an act of the Union of which they weren't the addressee reviewed by the Court, to establish that they had certain elements peculiar to them, that created the situation where they were almost as if (for the purposes of brevity in this medium) they were the actual addressee. The act so contested could be anything from a decision addressed to a third party, to a legislative act. The standard is however notoriously difficult to achieve, and for a public interest organisation, which aims to defend rights that concern a large cross section of the populace, differentiating themselves is neigh impossible. The NGO &lt;em&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/em&gt; famously tried and failed, where it objected to the subsidizing of a coal fired power plant on the Canary Island, with the Court reasoning that they could not be individually concerned, as &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; on the island was affected in the same manner. ClientEarth asserted that this interpretation was contrary to the Convention's goal of an open access to justice regime. It equally held that the other measures the that EU had adopted in order to comply with the Convention weren't enough to make up for the deficiencies in the overall system.The EU on its part defended itself by stating that the Aarhus Convention made it clear that legislative measures were exempt from the regime, and that most environmental acts by the EU at an EU level were of a legislative nature. 
The procedure has taken ages, in part due to the fact that the Lisbon Treaty had entered into force just before the start. The EU was of opinion that the addition of the &lt;em&gt;regulatory act&lt;/em&gt; would in fact ameliorate many of ClientEarth's complaints. However, to that end, there needed to be cases in which the Court of Justice would have the possibility to give an interpretation on the meaning of the &lt;em&gt;regulatory act&lt;/em&gt;. The result is that the protracted war over &lt;em&gt;individual concern&lt;/em&gt; had a lengthy détente after an interim opinion by the ACCC in which it expressed the belief that the Court would change its interpretation of the contentious term to comply with the Convention. Although it soon became clear that it would not, it is only now in 2017 that after re-notification by the communicants that the ACCC has given its final opinion on the compliance of the Union with the Aarhus Convention. As was expected, both from the the interim opinion as from the general opinion expressed by academic commentators. And yet, this opinion, or verdict if you will, will change absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Constitutional Courts and their Limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACCC is clear in its dismissal of the Commission's arguments, that is sees fault in the complete logical house that the Court has built around Article 263(4)TFEU. Both the interpretation of &lt;em&gt;individual concern&lt;/em&gt; and the later addition of the &lt;em&gt;regulatory act&lt;/em&gt; are too limiting for individuals and public interest organisations especially when they want to have acts reviewed that have an effect on their environment. However, this point has been raised numerous times even before the evolution of the EEC into the more full-fledged constitutional order that it is now. A number of authors have stated that there is an unfair distinction between the categories of applicants, that the strict requirements are merely docket-control, that the dogma goes against the Rule of Law, and yet this has never produced an effect. The Court has always held rather, that there exists in the EU a complete system of legal remedies and that where certain EU acts affect individuals (or organisations), it is for the Member States to facilitate suitable access to the courts. In his famous &lt;em&gt;UPA&lt;/em&gt; opinion AG Jacobs has already held that this answer is no longer suitable, as the Union has an ever greater direct effect (in the vernacular sense) on the lives of citizens and they should be able to address a suitable forum against such acts. Still the Court has not significantly shifted regarding public interest organisations, even though it has opened the Act for Annulment, such as it is formally known, in other substantial ways, most famously regarding the acts that can be reviewed. So why doesn't the Court just change its interpretation of &lt;em&gt;Plaumann&lt;/em&gt;?
It is the opinion of this authors that the Court does not, because it can not. The Court is bound by the Treaty as a constitutional document and the limits to its powers that lie therein. Even though the Court is the ultimate interpreter of the Treaty, like any other constitutional court, there are limits to this jurisdiction. During the last Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) that drafted the failed attempt for a constitution for Europe, it became clear that the drafters explicitly did not want easier direct involvement of non-privileged applicants through the Act for Annulment. The complex system of acts by the Union was of a more decentralised nature, and should therefore take place on the lower, Member State level. This is one of the reasons why the obligations placed on the Member States to ensure access to justice through their courts has been expanded upon. Not only are the Member States by the general loyalty principle, but the Treaty now also requires that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member States shall provide remedies sufficient to ensure effective legal protection in the fields covered by Union law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which achieved the same status at the Treaties with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, explicitly makes &lt;em&gt;caveats&lt;/em&gt; in both the Explanations, the document that gives the authoritative explanation of the articles in the Charter, and the Articles on its applicability that the Charter does not aim to substantively aim to change the system of rights and rights protection in the Treaty. It is (merely) a constitutionalisation of principles and the case-law that has found them. Should the Court therefore adopt a farther reaching interpretation of these standing criteria, it would go against the will of the drafters and the relationship that they have envisioned between the constitutional order, the institutions, the Member States, the citizens and the Court. This is not a &lt;em&gt;Marbury&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Madison&lt;/em&gt; situation, where the Court can interpret a vaguely formulated clause on its constitutional stewardship, as it was in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Tension between Legal Orders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates for greater judicial review possibilities will at this point now refer to the obligations under international law, incurred by the Union. Yet, this would not be the first time that the Court of Justice shows it's hostility towards intervention by international regimes. In the recent Opinion 2/13 on Accession of the European Union to the ECHR, the Court has dismissed this possibility on the grounds of the age old arguments of autonomy and supremacy. Unlike the limits to the Court's power to interpret it's standing requirements, this may be a monster of the Court's own creation. At the time of the &lt;em&gt;Van Gend &amp;amp; Loos&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Costa/ENEL&lt;/em&gt; judgments, the Court needed to undertake steps to give the new born EEC real life. If the ambitious ideas that underpinned the creation of the Communities were to flourish, the Court knew that it could not follow the traditional path of international agreements, such as they had existed until then. We now start every Introductory Course in EU law with these two judgments, and how the the Court 'created' an autonomous legal order that had primacy over the legal orders of the Member States. Without it, Member States would be able to shirk their responsibilities. To this day, much is written about what this means for the EU's constitutional framework, and it goes beyond the nature of this forum to give a complete overview, yet it is important to realise that the CJEU relied on these same concepts when it gave a negative opinion on accession to the ECHR. If the Union were to accept such international regimes, it would mean that EU law and (perhaps more importantly) the CJEU would no longer be the ultimate norm. The coherence and the autonomy of the legal order needs to be preserved and this, in the view of the Court, can only be achieved through primacy. This is the reason why it ruled in &lt;em&gt;Foto-Frost&lt;/em&gt; against National court's ability to review the legality of acts by the Union, this is equally the reason why there is a permanent Cold Disagreement between the German Constitutional Court and the CJEU on the position of national constitutionally guaranteed rights, and this is equally why the Aarhus Convention or the ACCC will have no effect on Primary Law or its interpretation. International law has a sub-constitutional status under the EU's legal order, were that not the case, than the autonomy of that legal order would be compromised. This is equally why the (then) EC had added a declaration to its signing of the Convention, in which it made it clear that it considered itself unable to fully implement the obligations under Article 9(3) on Access to Justice, of the Aarhus Convention, due to the nature of Acts undertaken by the Community. It considered it the task of the Member States, through Community law, to fulfil these obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven year period of bickering has now come to an end, and even though the environmentalists have won, when it comes to direct access to the Court, nothing will change. When forming an opinion on this point, one would do well to consider that most of the arguments in favour of opening up the standing requirements to public interest organisations are highly biased and brought forward by advocates for a more activist court, which protects the public interest against perceived injustice. It is a valid opinion to have and argue, yet it cannot be argued against a constitutional system that does not support this view. The Court declared in the appeal of &lt;em&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"{It is} admittedly, possible to envisage a system of judicial review of the legality of Community measures of general application different from that established by the founding Treaty and never amended as to its principles, it is for the Member States, if necessary, in accordance with Article 48 EU, to reform the system currently in force."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will readily declare my green credentials, and I am not opposed to judicial review on principle, yet if we, as citizens and environmentalists, want to make public interest litigation a possibility in the EU, we should stop to complain against the Court relying on vaguely substantiated claims regarding the Rule of Law, or cherry pick which International Agreements we like, and work towards comprehensive Treaty change. Or work with the tools that the Court &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; given us through interpreting the Aarhus Convention in the legal orders of the Member States, a new blog post that will soon follow.&lt;/p&gt;

The Bologna accords have tried to create a structure within which it is easy for students to study wherever they want. There have been many cases that emphasize the role of the exchange of students within the European project to further integration. Yet Member States have a dual view of these developments. On the one hand, they benefit from young talent that comes to their country and from the talent they send (and which hopefully returns) to gather knowledge. On the other, higher education is a costly affair and there is the constant fear of actually subsidizing students whose home-nation's education system is failing or to expensive. This has lead to complex systems of student support which often have a 'sufficient link' component. The Court of Justice has taken a strict approach to these systems. Although, as in social policy, Member States are allowed to require a sufficient link for students to be granted benefits, this policy can not be arbitrary or discriminatory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece will argue that a recent case against the Netherlands illustrates that the Court's conception of citizenship, foregoing in part the concept of nationality, is either to idealistic for its own good, or needs to be more rigorously enforced to truly solve issues of social polity.  Be forewarned that the following is not so much a legal analysis, as it is the opinion of the author on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Martens case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recently decided &lt;a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-359/13" title="Martens case"&gt;Martens case&lt;/a&gt; deals with the so-called three-out-of-six rule (3-6 rule) that establishes which persons are eligible for &lt;em&gt;Meeneembare Studie Financiering&lt;/em&gt; (MNSF) in the Netherlands. MNSF is the system that allows students to pursue a study outside of the Netherlands, but with the benefits of the &lt;em&gt;prestatiebeurs&lt;/em&gt; system (the basic scholarship at the time whereby part of the grant does not need to be reimbursed by the student if a ECTS limit is reached) that they would have enjoyed had they chosen a study within The Netherlands. The 3-6 rule states that this possibility will only be open for those prospective students that have spent at least three out of the six years preceding their studies in The Netherlands. It is a basic solidarity clause. Within the European Union, social benefits are to a certain extent allowed to be limited to persons who have demonstrated a certain connection to the benefactor state, yet as this case will demonstrate, it is a thin line to tread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miss Martens has Dutch nationality as she is born in the Netherlands to Dutch parents, who when she is six moved to Belgium. Consequently, she has resided there until she finished her primary and secondary education. Her father has worked in Belgium since moving there in 1993, and only briefly had part-time employment in the Netherlands from 2006 till 2008. After finishing her secondary education, she chose the Netherlands Antilles University in Curaçao as her place of tertiary education. In her application for MNSF, she stated that she had fulfilled the 3-6 rule after which she received her student grants. During her studies, the Belgian government supported her parents, yet as Belgium does not have a system of student grants in place, she herself did not receive financial support from the Belgian state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 it is established by the DUO that miss Martens had in fact not fulfilled the condition that she has lawfully resided in the Netherlands for three out of the preceding six years. As a result she was notified via a (delegated) decision by the Minister for Education that she was obliged to pay back the €19481.64 she had received. Miss Martens contested this decision, stating that this would go against her rights as the dependant of a cross border worker under Regulation 1612/68 and Article 45 TFEU. In earlier cases the Court had rejected such schemes and even explicitly the Dutch 3-6 rule, in case &lt;a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-542/09" title="Commission v. Netherlands"&gt;C-542/09&lt;/a&gt; as discriminatory with regards to cross border workers. The Centrale Raad van Beroep however makes a preliminary reference as the status of Miss Martens is not clear. Surely, miss Martens father is no longer to be considered a cross border worker for the sake of the definition of the awarding of MSNF. The referring tribunal is aware of the judgment in C-542/09, but considers this case to fall outside of that scope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The fall-out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Martens case is not only interesting for the, somewhat more political, point that the author intends to make in the following section. The A-G and the Court come to the same result, yes this case fall under the scope of C-542/09 and is not allowed, but via completely different routes. Whereas A-G Sharpston goes to great length to clarify that time since the father has made use of his worker's rights should not be an issue in these questions as the point is that rules such as the one under contention, limit the rights of each person to move, reside and find gainful employment within the European Union. A Dutch national would be deterred to seek cross-border employment if this results in the loss of rights for his dependants, such as student grants. The point of Union citizenship was, in the A-G's opinion of a secondary nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court however, bases its conclusion completely on the status of Union citizenship. The 3-6 rule will have a negative effect on the rights of EU citizens to make use of their rights under Article 21(1) of the TFEU. Union law does not force Member States to create a system of financial support for students, yet when they do choose to do so, these rules should not infringe upon the inherent rights of Union citizens to make use of the freedoms ensured by the Treaty and &lt;a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32004L0038" title="Citizenship Directive"&gt;Directive 2004/38&lt;/a&gt;. The 3-6 rule tries to establish a sufficient link between the Netherlands and the recipient of the grant, which is allowed (see &lt;a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-220/12" title="Thiele Meneses"&gt;C-220/12 Thiele Meneses&lt;/a&gt; ) yet it is disproportional. The Court is of the opinion that it: “[...]is [...] too exclusive because it does not make it possible to take account of other factors which may connect such a student to the Member State providing the benefit, such as the nationality of the student, his schooling, family, employment, language skills or the existence of other social and economic factors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The post-nation citizen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clear from the outset that the Netherlands would lose this case. There has been extensive case law on the free movement of students and, in all fairness, even though the former minister of education Halbe Zijlstra has argued that the 3-6 rule was drafted with European Law in mind, it is of a completely arbitrary nature. Yet it is the Court's firm wording on what grounds are allowed to confirm a sufficient link with the Member State that triggers the criticism of the author. It is the fact that the Court gives such primacy to the fundamental nature of European Citizenship which is becoming untenable in cases such as the one currently discussed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of Citizenship is to a large extent logical given the place it has been given since the Lisbon Treaty and the ongoing enmeshing of the Member States. If we accept the fact that, within certain logical limits, every EU citizen is allowed to freely make use of the shared space that the Treaties have created within the outer border of the Union, it is clear that there is a need for the elimination of those concrete hindrances such as the threat of loss of nationality (&lt;a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-135/08" title="Rottmann"&gt;C-135/08 Rottmann&lt;/a&gt;) or the expulsion of a third country national spouse (&lt;a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-202/13" title="McCarthy"&gt;C-202/13 McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;). The fact that the Court allows the protection of the basic tenets of the social-democratic state through the sufficient link doctrine is logical. However, the current case illustrates the problems the Union faces in this phase of transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is as follows, if Union Citizenship is the fundamental nature of all who are awarded this status, than why is miss Martens so beholden to the Dutch State. Yes, she has Dutch citizenship, yet her link with her motherland is tenuous at best. It is only the fact that there is a system of student support that has created a new relationship between her and the Netherlands. If Union Citizenship is our fundamental status, the focal point of our rights to live and reside where we want, and if we accept that social support schemes need a sufficient link to the benefactor state to be granted, than why is there still such a focus on the original nationality? The reasoning of the Court is both impractical in its idealism, yet at the same time does not carry the point far enough. Miss Martens is for all intents and purposes linked to the Belgian state. Had she chosen to reside somewhere else, that choice to reside should have been sufficient to be awarded the benefits that come with the place of residence. In an era of true post-nation citizenship, what does the label of being 'Dutch' or 'Belgian' mean except as an indicator of heritage, not of rights. Had the Court truly chosen for EU citizenship, it would have tried to minimise the role that nationality plays in this discussion. Why should mere heritage play a role in the awarding of benefits, where factual link and the choice one makes to work and reside is of so much more importance. EU Member State citizenship is what gives us EU citizens our status, but in a shared legal space in which we are all free to work and reside where ever we want, this should be the only point of importance. Who pays for social benefits or education or any other social scheme should be the State with which you have a conscious connection, the State that benefits from that connection, not the one which you only think of when you hand over a passport while boarding.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="eu law"></category><category term="citizenship"></category><category term="education"></category></entry><entry><title>Difficult to Relate</title><link href="http://mjvw.github.io/first-blog.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-05T23:55:00+01:00</published><author><name>mjvw</name></author><id>tag:mjvw.github.io,2017-02-05:first-blog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Judicial review has the peculiar quality that it is exemplary in illustrating the history and nature of a state, and in doing so it equally offers an insight into the relation between citizens and state. It is the one point in any judicial order in which all elements comprising the state, meet each other and the balance between them is made clear. Although foreseen in certain constitutional orders, in post-autocratic states such as France and the USA, the importance of judicial review has taken a leap in importance with the rise of the modern bureaucratic state. Where in earlier days there was a logic to limiting judicial review due to the fact that acts by government where often laden with at least some democratic gravitas, the bureaucratic state is filled with a plethors of agencies, each with different legal means, through which it interacts with citizens. Judicial review is, in short, an important indication of the nature of the State. It is the changing nature of the European Union that is giving the Court of Justice (CJEU) headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States have evolved in their take on judicial review. In France the review of legislative acts has always been impossible due to the historically strong role of parliament.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Administrative law was even held to be explicitly different, a lesser beast so to speak, compared to Private and Criminal law. Acts of a lower nature though, were never free from scrutiny and the administrative courts have slowly but surely taken a more progressive stance against the evolving state. Possibilities for review have expanded both in scope of applicants and in quality of the act. Perhaps the most striking example is the enormous development that the English legal system has gone through since WWII, in part due to for instance the judiciary reaction to the Crichel Down affair.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At the start of the twentieth century, it would be unheard of for a private applicant to successfully challenge the State. It was the State who embodied the notion of “The Public Good”. Yet through the judicial application of concepts as fairness, unreasonableness and the un-English concept of proportionality, England and Wales now poses a robust system of judicial review of administrative acts. Judicial review and all its aspects are therefore a legalised representation of the society in which it takes place; a sketch of the societal and democratic relations between institutions and citizens and the changes therein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now consider the system of judicial review as it is set up in European Law. Since the early days of the European Economic Community in 1962, the Court has held that private individuals are only permitted to request the review of an act of the (then) EEC or one of its institutions that is not addressed to that individual, when the individual is affected by that act due to specific circumstances that mark him in a manner as to being similar to an addressee.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This stems from the Courts interpretation of the term “individual concern” as it is mentioned in the article on the review of acts the (now) European Union: “Any natural or legal person may, under the conditions laid down in the first and second paragraphs, institute proceedings against an act addressed to that person or which is of direct and individual concern to them, and against a regulatory act which is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hurdle of individual concern has been very difficult to overcome. The very nature of EU law makes it virtually impossible for any party to claim that he or she is affected in such a specific manner as most acts will have a very wide and far reaching effect. Where it may seem logical in Member States to exclude legislative acts from judicial review in order to separate the powers, this separation can have a perverse effect in the European legal order. Commentary over the years has focussed its anger on the Court who, in the system of the European Union, is the ultimate interpreter and thus has the power to easily interpret the clause in any other way. Yet in 60 years since Plaumann, it has to much amazement never seen fit to do so. 
In discussions on the enforcement of environmental rights within the EU's legal order,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; an especially difficult discussion given the fact that these rights are by their nature not individualisable, it became clear that after 50 years of critique from both Academia&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the Court's own Advocates – General,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the Court does not merely see this as a strict interpretation of the Treaty text, but that this text reflects the nature of the legal instruments of the Union which are by and large of a legislative nature given the manner in which they are adopted. This has shed some light on the stance of the Court. As with the nature of the regimes in the Member States, the Court is of opinion that the high threshold for review is a reflection of the nature of the relationship between the Union and citizens. Since most of the acts undertaken are endowed with at least a modicum of democratic deliberation, they are not meant for the individual complainant to take issue with. This approach clarifies the constant reiteration by the CJEU that it is for Member States to provide full remedies,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; even when the complaint is addressed against a European act. The CJEU sees the national legal orders as the first step in a federal appeal system in which matters can be resolved through referral, not through direct appeal.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Given the above, the advent of the Lisbon Treaty inadvertently triggered an existential question for the Court. Although the Constitution for Europe and the overhaul of its legal instruments did not survive,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote10"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the Article on judicial review was adapted, in part as a reaction to the long history of criticism mentioned earlier.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote11"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, the change implicitly refers to a category of legal instrument that was foreseen in the Constitution and is now difficult to categorise. The result is that the restrictive qualifier 'individual concern' is no longer used “against a regulatory act which is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures.”. The problem being that “regulatory act” is a term of art unknown before Lisbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both textual scrutiny and the literal interpretation by the Court of Justice have yielded the most obvious meaning of this addition.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#myfootnote12"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There is now official recognition of the fact that the modern EU has a more direct relationship with its citizens that was previously deemed to be the case. Here the crux of the Court's current conundrum is found. Because although the drafters of the Treaty clearly envisioned this innovation to have only a limited reach, solving a problem with the smallest possible impact, there are groups such as the environmental movement who want to make full use of the possibilities this offers. And so, the interpretation of a seemingly small change has lead the Court to actually evaluate how it sees the relationship between Union and Citizens. If there is a direct relationship, then under the Court's own interpretation to the rule of law, citizens should be able to address possible infringements of their rights. However, the Court has to be well aware of the history in the Member States of the road that will be taken if this nascent form of administrative law were initiated. Like its founding members, the EU is undergoing the changes that every legal system goes through. The nature of the Union has kept it sheltered from this reality, yet that to has now passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main question is now whether the CJEU is going to follow the same route as many of its peers in the Member States. For the moment the answer appears to be “No”.  The drafting of the Lisbon Treaty has reinforced the Court's view of the relationship between citizen and EU. Consequently, it has interpreted both the concepts of “regulatory act not entailing implementing measures” and “direct concern” restrictively, whilst reaffirming its view of the decentralised nature of the European judicial structure. So even though the CJEU has brought about significant change in other legal orders, changes that have had a manifest impact on the relationship between citizens and Member States, it refuses to do so for the Union.&lt;/p&gt;
